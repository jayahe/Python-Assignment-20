    "_Bagging_: Bagging is also known as bootstrap sampling. It is process in which multiple models are built on different samples of the data(with replacement) considering all the features for every model, and aggregate of the values are cosndiered as a final output.Ex for numeric output mean is cosnidered and for categoric output mode of all the leaf nodes is considered.\n",

    "_Boosting_: Boosting is a process where in a final model built considering the errors from previous models. In short multiple models are built on different samples of the data and weights are assigned to all incorrect predictions, and inturn this is used as a input to build the final model.\n",
